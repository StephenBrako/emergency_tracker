      //I built this Ui in 2 hours, I have to be quick with this submission and
// so you'll have just the homepage, the drawer and corresponding blank sheets with animations. My previous works with flutter are private and
// I do not want to share the concept and source codes on github as you requested for a portfolio.
// The app coded here is a replica of the Myticketgh App on iOS appstore...slight changes just to make it unique. Thank you for the opportunity....I'll be honoured to hear from you soon.
